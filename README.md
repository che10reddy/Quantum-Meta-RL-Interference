## 📘 Overview
This repository currently hosts the combined appendices (A & B) for the research project  
**“Quantum Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Interference-Driven Policy Architectures.”**

The document unifies both theoretical and empirical analyses of **interference-driven generalization** in quantum policy spaces, forming the complete supplementary material to the main paper.

## ⚛️ Abstract
We develop a minimal two-qubit Hamiltonian model linking energy-landscape curvature to the information geometry of quantum kernels through  
\(\mathrm{Tr}(F_Q)=4\,\mathrm{Var}(H)\).  
Empirical validation at finite coupling confirms that constructive interference induces curvature-stable information geometry supporting robust cross-task adaptability in quantum meta-reinforcement learning.
