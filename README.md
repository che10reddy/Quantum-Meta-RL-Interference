# Quantum-Meta-RL-Interference

This repository currently includes **Appendix A** and **Appendix B** from the paper  
*“Quantum Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Interference-Driven Policy Architectures.”*  

These appendices contain:
- Appendix A: Theoretical Hamiltonian and information-geometric model  
- Appendix B: Empirical validation under finite coupling ($J_{zz}=0.8$)

The full main paper (Phases 1A–1C) will be added after final editing (target: Nov 10–16, 2025).
